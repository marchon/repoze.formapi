Overview
========

The ``repoze.formapi`` provides a form library which integrates with
HTML forms instead of abstracting them away.

It provides a small framework to take you through the entire process
of display forms, provide default values, validation and form action
processing.

Forms are defined using Python base types which map out nested data
structures with end points that are either integers, strings or
floats. It's up to the application to bridge these with more complex
objects.
